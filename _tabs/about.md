My name is Alex Veciana. I'm based off the sunny city of Valencia, Spain.

I successfully founded and launched several software automation solutions, reached 5 figures MRR on different products and exposition to international media such as [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/personal-finance/2021/01/21/playstation-5-calls-for-action-on-scalper-bots/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55740291), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/jan/22/scalper-bots-uk-xbox-series-x-playstation-5) and others.

Specialized in cybersecurity Penetration Testing as I have 4 years experience handling website automation and defeating anti-bot solutions, and finding ulnerabilities. I enjoy participating in CTF's and finding vulnerabilities on real targets and reporting bugs on platforms like [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/alexvec)

I am a very dedicated person, with excellent skills for communicating and working with clients remotely. All the teams I have built have been handled online without in-person participation. My skills vary from: ability to adapt to changes fast, good communication with customers and learning what the market demands. As much as I have an entrepreneurship mentality, I love learning from others and listening those who know more than me.
